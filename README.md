# Portfolio Webpage

## Description

This webpage displays a portfolio of work samples I have created. I intend to update this page as I develop and deploy more projects. I have utilized HTML and CSS to format and stylize the portfolio page. 

**Features include**:

- My name and a recent photo
- Anchor links to scroll through the webpage 
- Links to the deployed webpages in the portfolio and a link to my LinkedIn profile which contains my resume
- A responsive layout that adapts to a viewer's viewport
- Media queries for mobile devices such as phones and for small tablets
- When a user hovers over the image of a project, the photo becomes more saturated demonstrating the position of their cursor and to provide greater focus

This exercise was provided by Northwestern University and edX through the Coding boot camp. Submitted as fulfillment of the Module 02 exercise during the December, 2023 - June, 2024 cohort.

## Credits

 Initial code was not provided for this exercise and thus I wrote the HTML and CSS files myself. 

During the completion of this webpage, I encountered formatting issues and had questions pertaining to utilizing CSS styling. I received assistance from the Northwestern University Coding boot camp learning assistants, tutor, and teaching assistants. They did not provide code, but they suggested potential properties that I could investigate to resolve issues. Comments are provided within the HTML and CSS documents suggesting where these were implemented.
