            <p> <!-- Utilized a line break rather than 2 paragraphs -->
                My name is Anthony Rodriguez-Ortiz, I am a Research Data Analyst Associate with the Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine. 
                Primarily, I assist with our social and sexual network data research projects that utilize the internally developed Network Canvas software suite. 
                Two projects I would like to highlight include a social and sexual network data pilot examining HIV-1 in Ibadan, Nigeria. 
                The other project is a RADx-UP C3 studying examine COVID-19 behaviors and attitudes in the central United States. 
                I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2019, where I majored in Public Policy. <br>
                <br> <!-- Added to provide an empty line -->
                Currently, I am a student in the Northwestern Coding Boot Camp offered by Northwestern University and edX. My anticipated completion is early June, 2024. 
                I am interested in utilizing my experience in data analysis and social network research to assist in the development of research software or data analytic tools.
